Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?


This mod adds two new sets of pain genes, Threshold and Constant. Threshold genes change the point at which a pawn will fall unconcious due to pain. This can be used in conjunction with basic pain genes(excluding painless) to further customize how pawns react to pain. Constant genes add a constant pain to the pawn, causing a constant mood penalty(or bonus for masochists), while also making them more vulnerable falling unconcious due to injuries. Constant genes are incompatible with both pain genes and shock threshold genes. 

As a bonus, there are also two new genes that allow you to add the wimp and masochist traits to all members of the xenotype. Normally, I do everything I can to ensure traits remain separate from genes, but due to the nature of this mod, I felt like they actually fit here.


This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
